		<h2>My Biography</h2>
		<br>
		<p>	I grew up in an industrial city, about an hour outside of Philadelphia. A lot of the big employers -- steel, manufacturing, and even BellLabs -- are long gone now. Left for college in Virgina for 4 years, finishing with a bachelor's in economics from Washington and Lee University in Lexington. It's a cute little town, but if I had to do it over again I'd probably aim for college in New York or San Francisco.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>After college, I moved to Atlanta, GA to work as a research analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, studying math and finance at night. I worked in telecom after that as a data scientist, then studied industrial engineering for a while at Georgia Tech.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>Right at the end of 1999, I moved to San Francisco for a job opportunity with Telephia, a market research startup focused on mobile telecom and advertising. I started out as a data scentist. After a few years, I was offered the chance to run a sales team on an interim basis. Then I took over a flailing product - a fleet of vans that drove around the country measuring wireless network strength. I took over a team of 100 people, and took on some very angry customers, but managed to turn it around, double the product's revenue and make it profitable. I moved to business development -- new products, customers, and techologies -- and was one of the six management team members that sold the business to Nielsen in 2007 for $440M.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>I took a year off to spend time with family, then got hired as the CEO of Sense Networks, a location data startup founced by a couple of computer scientists from M.I.T. and Columbia University. The company had no products, customers, or revenue. I raised venture capital, turned over the team, sold the company's platform as enterprise software to wireless carriers. Aiming for a higher growth market, we pivoted in 2012 to mobile advertising, becoming a "demand side platform" in the new world of real-time bidding and ad exchanges. Drove the company to a $5M annualized revenue run rate. Seeing the competition in the market, we decided to sell the business to YP (aka Yellow Pages) in 2014, getting a 6x revenue multiple on the deal.
